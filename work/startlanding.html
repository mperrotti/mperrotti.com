        <p>Starting a Meetup group is a big decision for any user to make. I worked with Meetup's strategy team and usability lab to figure out what made people most uneasy about organizing a Meetup group, and designed a page to address  those fears and let users move forward confident about the community they want to build.</p>
        <p>Before this page existed, people were sent into the group creation flow with no information about what organizing a Meetup actually means, what Meetup does to help you build a community, and often not knowing that it costs money to become an organizer.</p>
        <p>This page's content is often undergoing multivariate tests based on research about what makes people anxious about getting their group started so we can learn what messaging is relevant to a user who isn't sure whether or not they want to start a Meetup group.</p>

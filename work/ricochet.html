        <p>When Salon Ricochet came to me asking for a redesign, I first pointed them to Squarespace. After taking a look at what they had to offer, they still decided they wanted something built custom. The redesign was done to make the site feel good to use on mobile, improve the visual design to reflect Ricochet's personality, and bring the contact information front-and-center.</p>
        <p>I pushed for allowing customers to book an appointment online, but online booking had actually hurt business in the past. Customers who booked appointments online proved to be less likely to actually show up.</p>

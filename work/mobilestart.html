    <div class="project-description">
        <p>As we started to see more of our users shift to mobile platforms, we needed to design and build a simple flow to let people start their Meetup groups from their phone.</p>
        <p>After looking at what steps people were dropping off at, I iterated on the design and built a responsive prototype that can be seen <a href="http://mperrotti.com/start">here</a></p>
        <p>This flow is only on mobile web right now, but another designer is working on native iOS and Android designs, and replacing the desktop group start flow with a responsive start flow.</p>

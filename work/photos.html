        <p>The say "a picture is worth a thousand words", so one of the first desktop features we needed to bring to mobile was the ability to browse and comment on a Meetup group's photos and albums. Photos are one of the most engaging parts of browsing a Meetup group, but developing this feature was necessary to pave the way for future plans related to the redesign.</p>
        <p>Even though the photos experience was designed and built to be responsive, the redesigned photo album experience is only launched on mobile web. Next year when we re-architect our front-end tech stack and we have a responsive Meetup group experience, this new design for looking through a group's photos will be launched across the entire web.</p>
        <p>We quietly launched the new photos experience, and here's what we saw: the rate of people leaving Meetup after landing on a photo page drop dramatically and performing even better than our desktop photo pages, and the number of photos viewed went up, trending slightly higher than desktop.</p>

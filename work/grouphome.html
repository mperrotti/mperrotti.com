    <div class="project-description">
        <p>The mobile Group home design started as a responsive redesign of the desktop web's Meetup group experience. The original plan was to first launch on mobile to measure impact, then bring more of the desktop features to mobile web, and finally release a consistent group experience across all platforms. Due to shifting priorities and developer resources, we ended up only having to halt work on newer features. This brought our team to the decision to keep the redesign only on mobile, but build it in a way that would make it easy to finish the bigger feature set that would allow us to launch across all platforms.</p>
        <p>This was the first project to use our new and evolving design system via our CSS framework, Sassquatch2. Most of this design system was developed alongside this project. This helped to identify what kinds of patterns and components that other designers  might need when building other products.</p>
        <p>
            We weren't expecting any major shifts in our metrics from this launch, but here's what happened:
            <ul>
                <li>&middot; Members and organizers spent significantly longer using the mobile website</li>
                <li>&middot; We improved front-end speed and perfomance</li>
                <li>&middot; There was an increase in people contributing money to their Meetup groups</li>
                <li>&middot; More people were joining groups on mobile web</li>
                <li>&middot; More people were registering on mobile web</li>
                <li>&middot; More people than we expected clicked the topic tags to explore new Meetup groups</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <div class="project-description">
        <p>After 12 years of technical and design debt accruing on Meetup.com, and a massive rebrand on the horizon, it was clear we needed create to create a design system to work with. The system would need to be flexible enough to work and get updated into the future, while creating a consistent user experience, and make it faster to ship a good product. It's an atomic design system to support the most common kinds of content on Meetup. It's optimized for smaller screens, but still feels at home on large screen. The core components are typography, layout, and smart defaults for things like colors, media sizes, layout breakpoints.</p>

        <p>The Microtarget unit was first conceived as a means to get more Meetup groups started by users who may not have thought to start one otherwise. I worked with a product manager to coordinate with the backend engineers and target users based on criteria like their location, if there were local Meetups relevant to a user's interests, and how long they'd been using Meetup. This information was then used to pick a unit a populate it with content relevant to that user. The Microtarget experiements helped us learn a little more about what makes people less anxious about starting a Meetup group. At it's peak, the Microtarget helped increase traffic into the group start funnel 45%</p>
        <p>This unit was even used to target other helpful messaging to users, like letting organizers know they were close to reaching the 50-member limit on the Basic organizer subscription, and asking members to chip in money to their organizers after they had RSVP'd yes to events in their group.</p>
        <p>It needed to be smart under the hood, but simple enough that a product manager or designer wouldn't have to ask engineers to update the content or set up the rules for who to target targeting every time we wanted to create a new Microtarget.</p>
        <p>This unit was rapidly iterated and experimented on. We had to build small, sharp tools to make managing and monitoring this unit simpler for stakeholders.</p>

    <p>One of the admin tools was simply for measuring the success of the units and toggling them on or off</p>

    <p>We also needed a tool for creating multi-variant tests with different copy and image treatments when applicable</p>

    <p>Another admin tool was used as an interface for the backend creating criteria a user must fulfill to see this unit and where they would see it</p>
